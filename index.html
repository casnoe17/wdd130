                Hello! My name is Tyler Case and I am from Parowan, Utah, USA. My wife and I have been married 13 years and have 5 children with another on the way.
                We also have a kitten who loves to sit on my keyboard whenever he gets the chance. I work for the company Ricoh USA as a customer helpdesk analyst.
                I enjoy playing video games, tabletop miniatures, board games, tabletop RPGs, shooting guns, and reading books.
            </p>
